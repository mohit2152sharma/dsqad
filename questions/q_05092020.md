3. Type 1 error and Type 2 error

## Options:
1. Option A
2. Option B
3. Option C
4. Option D

## Correct Option:
4. Option D

## Explanation:
False positives occur due to the rejection of true null hypothesis, which is the region to the right of cutoff values and under $H_0$. By moving the cut-offs to the right, the false positives can be minimized but at the expense of raising the false negatives i.e. not rejecting false null hypothesis.
