## Question:
Do the following two commands in R give the same output?
```r
#command 1
!1 + 1

#command 2
1 + !1
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Operator Precedence

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
Due to operator precedence, the two commands do not give same output. The first command is equivalent to `!(1+1)` and the second command is equivalent to `1+!1`. Also due to implicit coercion, in the first command, `!(1+1)` is converted to `FALSE` because of the last logical operation. In the second command `!1` is first converted to `FALSE` and then due to `+` converted back to `1`. Hence the first command gives the output `TRUE` and the second command gives the output `1`.
``` r
#command 1:
!1 + 1
#> [1] FALSE

#command 2:
1 + !1
#> [1] 1
```
