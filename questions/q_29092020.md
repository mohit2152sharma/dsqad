## Correct Option:

## Explanation:
In R, a variable name cannot begin with `_` or digits and must only consists of letters, digits, `.` or `_`. There are reserved words also which can't be used for variable names, to check the whole list of reserved words try `?Reserved` in R. Although it's possible to override these rules and use any variable name by enclosing it in backlists like ```_abc``` or ```if```. (You can also create these variables using single or double quotes e.g. `"_abc" <- 1`)
