## Correct Option:
1. One-way ANOVA

In the above example, one-way anova can be used to compare the average scores of different groups. With ANOVA, we can compare wider number of groups, unlike t-test, in which we were only comparing two groups. One-way ANOVA is an omnibus test statistic and cannot tell which two groups are statistically significantly different from each other, it only tells that at least two groups were different.
