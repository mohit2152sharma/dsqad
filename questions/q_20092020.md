## Question:
If we have $n$ data points, what is the probability that a given data point does not appear in a bootstrap sample?

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Probability and Statistics
3. Bootstrap

## Options:
1. $(1 - (1/n))^n$
2. $(1/n)^n$
3. $1 - (1/n)^n$

## Correct Option:
1. $(1 - (1/n))^n$

## Explanation:
In bootstrap we randomly select $n$ observations from a data set, with replacement i.e. a data point can be selected more than once. Bootstrap is a useful technique to find measures like variance, confidence intervals, prediction error etc associated with sampling estimates. 

In the above question, we have $n$ data points. The probability of selecting one point is therefore $1/n$. The probability of not selecting that point is $1 - (1/n). And this has to be repeated $n$ times. 

So, the probability a data point doesn't appear in bootstrap sample is $(1 - (1/n))^n$.
