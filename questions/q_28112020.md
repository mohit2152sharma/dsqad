## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Arbitary Arguments

## Options:
1. ```python
	def greeting(names):
        pass
    ```
2. ```python
	def greeting(*names):
        pass
    ```
3. ```python
	def greeting(**names):
        pass
    ```
4. ```python
	def greeting(...):
        pass
    ```

## Correct Option:
3. ```python
	def greeting(**names):
        pass
    ```

## Explanation:
In python, arbitary named arguments can be passed to a function as a named dictionary using `**`. Also, using `*` arbitary number of arguments can be passed to a function as a list. 
```python
>>> def func(**params):
...     for key, value in params.items():
...             print(f"{key}: {value}")
...
>>> func(first = 1, second = 2, third = 3)
first: 1
second: 2
third: 3
```
