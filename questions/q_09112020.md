## Question:
Suppose `x` is a linear regression formula as given below, what happens when you try to convert that expression into a string in R?
```r
x = y ~ a + b
as.character(x)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `as.character()`

## Options:
1. `"y ~ a + b"`
2. `"~"    "y"    "a + b"`
3. `NA`
4. Error

## Correct Option:
2. `"~"    "y"    "a + b"`

## Explanation:
`as.character()` attempts to coerce its argument to character type. For language objects such as calls, it deparses the elements individually. Since `x` is a three element object, we get option 2 as an answer. `deparse()` is normally preferred to `as.character()` for language objects.

``` r
x = y ~ a + b
as.list(x)
#> [[1]]
#> `~`
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> y
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> a + b

as.character(x)
#> [1] "~"     "y"     "a + b"

deparse(x)
#> [1] "y ~ a + b"
```
