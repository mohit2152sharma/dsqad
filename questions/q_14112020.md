## Question:
What is the value of `x`? (code is in python)
```python
def add(m,n):
    sum = m + n

x = add(3,4)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python

## Options:
1. `None`
2. `7`
3. `3`
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
1. `None`

## Explanation:
To return a value from the function, python explicitly requires `return` statement. Also note that it is not necessary to enclose the return value in a parenthesis. 

```python
>>> def add(m,n):
...     sum = m+n
...		return sum
...
>>> x = add(3,4)
>>> print(x)
7
```

If a `return` statement is not provided, which is the case in the question, the function returns `None` value.

```python
>>> def add(m,n):
...     sum = m+n
...
>>> x = add(3,4)
>>> print(x)
None
```
