## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `NA`

## Options:
1. `NA`
2. `numeric`
3. `NULL`
4. `logical`

## Correct Option:
4. `logical`

## Explanation:
`NA` is a logical constant of length 1.
``` r
typeof(NA)
#> [1] "logical"
```
`NA` can be coerced to any other vector type except raw. There are also constants `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`, `NA_complex_` and `NA_character_` of the other atomic vector types which support missing values.
