## Question:
Suppose four matrices are given $A, B, C$ and $D$ with dimensions $(1,n), (n,n), (n,n)$ and (n,1) respectively. We wish to calculate $ABCD$. Which of the following multiplication would be least computationally expensive assuming conventional nested loop multiplication algorithm?

## Options:
1. $(AB)(CD)$
2. $(A(BC))D$
3. $A((BC)D)$
4. All would be same

## Correct Option:
1. $(AB)(CD)$

## Explanation:
Option 1, $(AB)(CD)$ would cost $2n^2 +n$, whereas option 2 and option 3 would cost $n^3 + n^2 +n$ iterations.
