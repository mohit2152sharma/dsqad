## Question:
You are using `ggplot2` library for plotting the `mpg` dataset. It is given that `hwy` is a continuous variable. What happens when you try to plot using the following command?

```r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
	geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = cty, shape = hwy))
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `ggplot()`

## Options:
1. A plot with each `hwy` number mapped to a distinct shape
2. A plot but `hwy` is ignored
3. Error
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
3. Error

## Explanation:
The use of aesthetic `shape` is best suited for categorical variables. When it is used with continuous variable, an error is thrown.
``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty, shape = hwy))
#> Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape
```
