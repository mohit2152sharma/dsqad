## Question:
Environments in R behave similar to list. Would the following code snippet work?

```r
#using pkg rlang to create environment
env = rlang::env(
  'a' = 1,
  'b' = 1:10,
  'c' = list(1,'x', 2)
)
env[[1]]
```

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
Calling the objects of environment using index will not work as the names (of objects) in 
environment are unordered. It will throw a subsetting error.

```r
env = rlang::env(
  'a' = 1,
  'b' = 1:10,
  'c' = list(1,'x', 2)
)
env[[1]]
#> Error in env[[1]]: wrong arguments for subsetting an environment
```
Use names to call out objects. For example:
```r
env = rlang::env(
  'a' = 1,
  'b' = 1:10,
  'c' = list(1,'x', 2)
)

env[['a']] #or env$a
#> [1] 1
```
