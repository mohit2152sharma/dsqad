## Question:
Often times, you come across a use case where you need to evaluate a text string, like `"1+2"`. Which of the following would help you to evaluate the string `"1+2"` and produce the output `3`?
 
## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `eval()` and `parse()`

## Options:
1. `eval("1+2")`
2. `parse("1+2")`
3. `eval(parse(text= "1+2"))`
4. `sum(as.numeric("1+2")`

## Correct Option:
3. `eval(parse(text="1+2"))`

## Explanation:
`eval()` evaluates an expression and computes it's value, and `parse()` returns the parsed but an unevaluated expressions. So in our example, `"1+2"` is first converted into an expression by `parse()` which is then evaluated by `eval()`. Note that there are some shortcomings of the `eval()` `parse()` combination, as it can evaluate any expression. So for example, if you put it in a shiny app, it would be unsafe as it can be exploited to do injection attacks.
