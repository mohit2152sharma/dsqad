## Options:
1. 1st is TRUE
2. 2nd and 3rd are TRUE
3. Only 4th is TRUE
4. Only 5th is TRUE 

## Correct Option:
2. 2nd and 3rd are TRUE

## Explanation:
Since everything is treated as function in R, the statement is similar to ``sum(`<-`(z, c(1,2,3,4)))``, function within a function are allowed. Note that `sum(z = c(1,2,3,4))` won't work, in this case `z` is treated as an argument of `sum()`. This could be a handy way when you want to assign a value to some variable and also want to see the value in the console, for example `(z <- mean(c(1,2,3,4))` would assign the mean to `z` and will also print it on the console.
