## Options:
1. Only A
2. Only B and C
3. Only A and C
4. All of the above 

## Correct Option:
2. Only B and C

## Explanation:
In python, the strings can be concatenated using `+` operator. Also, the method `join()` can be used to concatenate a list of strings. It takes a list as an argument and the string before `.join()` (in this case `' '`) specifies the string by which one wants to join the string.
```python
>>> first_name = 'Jhon'
>>> last_name = 'Wick'

>>> first_name + last_name
'JhonWick'

>>> first_name + ' ' + last_name
'Jhon Wick'

>>> ' '.join([first_name, last_name])
'Jhon Wick'

>>> ', '.join([first_name, last_name])
'Jhon, Wick'
```
