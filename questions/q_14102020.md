## Question:
What happens when you try to index with `NA`, so for example what would be the output of last line in the following code in R?
``` r
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
x[c(1,NA)]
#> [1]  1 NA
x[c(NA, NA)]
```

## Options:
1. `NA NA`
2. `NA NA NA NA NA`
3. `1 2`
4. `1 2 3 4 5`

## Correct Option:
2. `NA NA NA NA NA`

## Explanation:
In the first case `x[c(1,NA)]`, the `NA` is coerced to `NA_integer_` due to the presence of `1` in the vector and since the indexing vector is numeric, the indexing vector is not recycled and we get as an output `1 NA`. In the second case, the indexing vector is logical (`NA`'s are of type logical) and logical vectors are recycled when used in indexing. So we are actually indexing with `c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)` and hence as an output we get `NA NA NA NA NA`.
``` r
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
x[c(1,NA)]
#> [1]  1 NA
x[c(NA, NA)]
#> [1] NA NA NA NA NA
```
