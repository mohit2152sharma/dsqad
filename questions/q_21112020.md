## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Docstring

## Options:
1. 1
2. 1 and 2
3. 3
4. 1, 2 and 4

## Correct Option:
3. 3

## Explanation:
As functions become more complex, it becomes important to provide some documentation about function and it's parameters. In python, the docstring does that. The docstring can be passed similar to how strings are written in python, enclosing in single, double or triple quotes. The docstring is also available to IDEs and can be accessed using the method `__doc__`. 

```python
>>> def func():
...     "This is a docstring"
...     pass
...
>>> func.__doc__
'This is a docstring'
```
