## Question:
When you try to check the class of `x`, you get a character vector, as shown below. Whihc of the given options are true?
```r
x = ordered(1:10)
class(x)
#> [1] "ordered" "factor"
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. S3 Class

## Options:
1. "factor" is the base class
2. "ordered" inherits from "factor"
3. if a method is missing for "ordered", method of "factor" will be used
4. All of the above

## Correct Option:
4. All of the above

## Explanation:
`x` is an S3 object. S3 is an OOP system in R. R has many OOP system like R6, S4. S3 objects have `class` attribute. `class()` returns a character vector of classes. You can overwrite the `class` attribute, often times leading to unintended behaviour, S3 doesn't have any checks to prevent you from doing that. 
```r
x = factor('a')
class(x) = 'something'
class(x)
#> [1] "something"
```
To create an object of certain class, you can assign by using `class()` or using `structure()`. 
``` r
x = structure(c('a', 'b'), class='names')
x
#> [1] "a" "b"
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "names"
x = c('a', 'b')
class(x) = 'names'
x
#> [1] "a" "b"
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "names"
```
When you check the class of an object. The returned vector tells you the inherited classes and their order of inheritance. So in the below example, "factor" is the base class and "ordered" has inherited from "factor" or in other words, "factor" is the super class & "ordered" is the sub class.
``` r
x = ordered(1:10)
class(x)
#> [1] "ordered" "factor"
```
The order of inheritance is used when the object is passed to generic functions like `print()`, `plot()`, `summary()`. Briefly speaking, the generics use the class name to find a function associated with that particular class (method) and executes it. For example, In the given image, when the 1st `print()` is called, `print()` tries to search for a function `print.programmer()` but didn't find so printed with `print.deault()` just throwing out all the info, but in 2nd case, since `print.programmer()` is defined it prints using `print.programmer()`.
``` r
programmer = function(name, language, experience){
  #return an object of class programmer
  structure(
    list('name' = name,
         'language' = language,
         'experience' = experience),
    class = 'programmer'
  )
}

print(programmer('DSQAD', 'R', 5))
#> $name
#> [1] "DSQAD"
#> 
#> $language
#> [1] "R"
#> 
#> $experience
#> [1] 5
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "programmer"

#using the generic function print I can prettify the printing
print.programmer = function(object){
  cat("Programmer's Name:", object$name, "\n")
  cat("Programmer's favourite language:", object$language, "\n")
  cat("Programmer's experience:", object$experience, "\n")
}

print(programmer("DSQAD", "R", 5))
#> Programmer's Name: DSQAD 
#> Programmer's favourite language: R 
#> Programmer's experience: 5
```
