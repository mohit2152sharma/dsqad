## Question:
What would be the output of the two print statements in the following code in python?

```python
def add_num(num):
    return num+1

def reset_function():
    global add_num
    to_add = 50
    add_num = lambda num: num + to_add

print(add_num(5))
reset_function()
print(add_num(5))
```

## Options:
1. 6 and 6
2. 6 and 55
3. 55 and 55
4. Error

## Correct Option:
2. 6 and 55

## Explanation:
A closure is a function together with a referencing environment. This example illustrates the concept of closure. The first `print()` call, uses the first definition of `add_num()` which adds 1 to a given number hence the output is 6. But after that, `reset_function()` is called which overrides the initial definition of `add_num()` with a newly defined lambda function. Note that the lambda function uses a variable `to_add` which is local to the `reset_function()` and not available in global environment and yet when `add_num()` is executed in the global environment, it remembers the value of `to_add` (because of *closures*) and returns the output 55, which is the case with last print statement. 

```python
>>> def add_num(num):
...     return num+1
...
>>> def reset_function():
...     global add_num
...     to_add = 50
...     add_num = lambda num: num + to_add
... 
>>> print(add_num(5))
6
>>> reset_function()
>>> print(add_num(5))
55
```
