## Question:
When you try to load data like `AirPassengers` in R, using the function `data()`, the dataset is loaded as a `Promise`, rather than a `dataframe`. What is `Promise`?

## Topic:
Object Types: R

## Options:
1. An unevaluated expression
2. An environment for expression's evaluation
3. A placeholder to hold the expression's value
4. All of the above 

## Correct Option:
4. All of the above

## Explanation:
A `promise` in R is a data structure, which powers it's lazy evaluation mechanism. It holds an expression, which is not evaluated until it is forced in an environment and once it is forced, it caches the value. It's sort of like you are telling R to hold on to an expression and don't evaluate it, until I specifically ask for it.

In other words, a `promise` has three slots: a expression to evaluate, an environment to evaluate the expression in, and a variable (name) to hold (or cache) the value of an evaluated expression.

It allows you to do crazy things like:
1. Assigning a variable as a function argument which is defined inside a function.
```r
function(x = z){
    z = 10
    x = z
    x
}
```
2. Or evaluating expression in one environment and assigning output in another environment.
``` r
env = new.env()

f = function(x){
  delayedAssign(
    'var',
    {z = 1:20; mean(1:6)},
    eval.env = env,
    assign.env = .GlobalEnv
  )
  x
}

f(10)
#> [1] 10

# at this point var is stored as a promise in global environment as it's evaluation is not yet forced.
# and there is no way (atleast to my knowledge) to check whether an object is promise or not
ls()
#> [1] "env" "f"   "var"

# forcing evaluation
var
#> [1] 3.5

# variable z is not defined in global env
ls()
#> [1] "env" "f"   "var"

#variable z is defined in 'env' environment
ls(env)
#> [1] "z"
```
