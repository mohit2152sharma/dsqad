## Question:
The following in R would give?
```r
c(TRUE, FALSE) | c(NA, NA)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `|`

## Options:
1. `NA NA`
2. `TRUE NA`
3. `NA FALSE`
4. `NA`

## Correct Option:
2. `TRUE NA`

## Explanation:
`|` is a vectorized operator which does elementwise operation. It's counterpart `||` is a non-vectorized operator which only compares the first element. Numerical and logical calculations with `NA` generally returns `NA`. In cases where the result of the operation would be the same for all possible values the `NA` could take, the operation may return this value. In particular, `TRUE | NA` is `TRUE`. Hence in the above question, the first comparison yields `TRUE` and the second comparison yields `NA`.
``` r
c(TRUE, FALSE) | c(NA, NA)
#> [1] TRUE   NA
```
