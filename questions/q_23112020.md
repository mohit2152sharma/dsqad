## Question:
In R, `sample()` can be used for sampling. What would be the output of following code?

```r
x = 1:10
y = sample(x[x>9])
length(y)
```

## Topic:

3. `sample()`

## Options:
1. 1
2. Error
3. 10
4. Cannot tell, as sample does random sampling

## Correct Option:
3. 10

## Explanation:
In R, `sample()` can be used to take out sample of specifized size from the elements of `x` with or without replacement. If `x` is of length 1 and is numeric, the result of `sample(x)` can surprise as sampling takes place from `1:x`. 
``` r
x = 1:10
y = sample(x[x>9])
length(y)
#> [1] 10
y
#>  [1] 10  8  6  3  7  1  2  5  9  4
```
