3. 441
4. 22

## Correct Option:
1. 202

## Explanation:
R uses lexical scoping, it looks for a variable/function in the current environment, if it doesn't find it then it moves one level up. In the above example, there are three `f`s defined. `f(10)` uses the outermost `f`, `f(x)*2` uses the second `f` and `f()+1` uses the innermost `f`'s definition. We can see which one got executed when, by wrapping the execution statements with `print()`.
``` r
f <- function(x) {
  f <- function(x) {
    f <- function() {
      print(x ^ 2)
    }
    print(f() + 1)
  }
  print(f(x) * 2)
}
f(10)
#> [1] 100
#> [1] 101
#> [1] 202
```
