## Question:
In python you can index a string like the following example:
```python
x = "This is a string example"
x[0:4]
#> 'This'
```
Should the following replacement also work?
```python
x = "This is a string example"
x[0:4] = "That"
```

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
In python, strings are immutable, that means, once created they cannot be changed. If you try to change a string you will in fact create a new string, containing whatever modifications you made, you will not affect the original string in anyway.
```python
>>> x = "This is a string"
>>> x[0:4] = "That"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```
To replace, one can use the `replace()` method for string.
