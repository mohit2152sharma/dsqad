## Question:
In R, which of the following command would result in a model through origin (or without intercepts)?

1. `lm(y ~ x + 0)`
2. `lm(y ~ 0 + x)`
3. `lm(y ~ x - 1)`
4. `lm(y ~ x)`

3. Linear Regression

## Options:
1. 1 and 2 only
2. 1, 2 and 3 only
3. Only 3
4. Only 4

## Correct Option:
2. 1, 2 and 3 only

## Explanation:
The operator `-` removes the specified terms. It can also be use to remove the intercept term, i.e. when fittign a linear model `y ~ x - 1` specifies a line through the origin. A model with no intercept can be also specified as `y ~ x + 0` or `y ~ 0 + x`.
