## Question:
In R programming, `all.equal()` function can be used to compare near equality of two objects `x` and `y`. What would the following code return?
```r
x = c( 1, 2, 3)
y = c( 1, 3, 2)
if(all.equal(x,y)) "vectors are equal" else "vectors are not equal"
```

## Topic:
1. R programming
2. `all.equal()` Function

## Options:
1. vectors are equal
2. vectors are not equal
3. Mean relative difference: 0.4
4. Error

## Correct Option:
4. Error
4. Error
4. Error

## Explanation:
`all.equal(x, y)` is a utility to compare R objects `x` and `y` testing "near equality". If they are different, comparison is still made and a report of the difference is returned. If they are equal, `TRUE` is returned. Although, it might seem intuitive to use `all.equal()` in `if` expressions but the expression would not give you expected results for `FALSE` condition. Either use `isTRUE(all.equal(...))` or `identical()` when appropriate.
In the above example: `all.equal(x,y)` would return `Mean relative difference: 0.4`, which is not interpretable as logical value hence `if` expression would throw an error.
