## Question:
Suppose you are fitting a simple linear regression model of the form $\hat{y}=\beta_0 + \beta_1x$. The model has $R^2 = 0.10$ and F-statistic test's $p-value = 0.0067$. (The cut-off for $p-value$ is $0.05$)

## Topic:
1. F-Statistic test

## Options:
1. model doesn't explain much variation of the data but model is significant
2. model explains a lot of the variation of the data but model is not significant
3. model explains a lot of the variation of the data and the model is significant
4. neither the model explains the variation of the data nor it is significant

## Correct Option:
1. model doesn't explain much variation of the data but model is significant

## Explanation:
F-Statistic test in linear regression setting, tests if the fit of your model (with variables) is equal to an intercept only model. If p-value is greater than your cut off level, then your model is no better than an intercept only model, if it is less than your cut off value than the alternate hypothesis is true, i.e. model with variables is better than an intercept only model. Whereas R square is the measure of variance explained by our model, higher value means, the model is able to explain much of the variation in response variable around it's mean.
