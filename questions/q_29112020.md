## Question:
In python, which of the following is a correct way to define a function?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Functions

## Options:
1. `def f(b=10, a):`
2. `def f(a, b):`
3. `def f(a, b, **kwargs, *args):`
4. `def f(a, **kwargs, b):`

## Correct Option:
2. `def f(a, b):`

## Explanation:
In python, for a function, the order of arguments matters. `**` always follows the rest of the arguments, therefore option 3 and option 4 would result in an error. Similarly default arguments always follows the non default arguments, therefore option 1 would result in an error. 

In python the correct function definition would be:
```python
def f(a, b, c=10, *args, **kwargs):
```
or 
```python
def f(a, b, *args, c=10, **kwargs):
```

The difference in the above two is, while in first, `c` can be passed as both positional or named argument, whereas in second, it can only be passed as named argument, since it comes after `*args`.
