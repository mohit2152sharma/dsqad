## Question:
Which of the following option is correct for the following code?

```
x = list(
  y = c(1,2,3),
  z = c("a", "b", "c")
)

is.na(x$y) <- 3
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `is.na()`

## Options:
1. All the elements of `y` will be replaced with `NA`
2. Only the 3rd element of `y` will be replaced with `NA`
3. No replacement will take place and `y` will remain the same
4. An Error will be thrown

## Correct Option:
2. Only the 3rd element of `y` will be replaced with `NA`

## Explanation:
The generic function `is.na()` identifies which elements are `NA` (by returning TRUE), whereas the function `is.na<-` sets elements to `NA`. The RHS (for the function `is.na<-`) is the index of the element you want to set to `NA`.

``` r
x = list(
  y = c(1,2,3),
  z = c("a", "b", "c")
)

is.na(x$y) <- 3

x
#> $y
#> [1]  1  2 NA
#> 
#> $z
#> [1] "a" "b" "c"
```
