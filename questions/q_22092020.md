## Question:
Although unadvisable, but it’s interesting how scoping works in R. R allows function and variable to have same name. What does the following code return?

```r
g09 <- function(x) x + 100
g10 <- function() {
  g09 <- 10
  g09(g09)
}
g10()
```

## Topic:

2. R
3. Variable Scoping

## Options:
1. Error
2. 110
3. 10
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
2. 110

## Explanation:
```r
g09 <- function(x) x + 100
g10 <- function() {
  g09 <- 10
  g09(g09)
}
g10()
#> [1] 110
```

This could only work when the function and variable are defined in different environments. When the function with same name is called, it ignores the non-functional objects like variables. In the above example, when function g09() is called, it igonres the variable g09 and looks for the function object with g09 name. Since both are defined in different environments, variable g09 is defined in function g10’s environment, whereas g09() is defined in global environment, I don’t get an error when executing the above code.
