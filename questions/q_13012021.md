## Question:
In python an object of which of the following type is not a mutable object?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python

## Options:
1. List
2. Dictionary
3. Set
4. Tuple

## Correct Option:
4. Tuple

## Explanation:
In python, mutable objects can change their state and contents whereas immutable objects cannot. Objects of type List, Dictionary and Set are mutable, whereas the objects of type String, Int, Float, Bool and Tuple are immutable. If you try to change an element of immutable objects it will throw an error, for example:

```python
>>> x = [1,2,3,4]
>>> type(x)
<class 'list'>
>>> x[1] = 3
>>> x
[1, 3, 3, 4]
>>> y = (1,2,3,4)
>>> type(y)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> y[1] = 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
