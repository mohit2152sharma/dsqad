## Question:
Suppose you have a vector `x` and you aren't sure about the length of vector. You have to iterate through each element of vector
to apply some function. Would the following code be safe?
```
for(i in 1:length(x)){
    some_function(x[i])
}
```

3. `seq_along()`

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
Using `length()` can be unsafe. Much safer alternative is `seq_along()`. For most cases, `length()` would behave as expected but, it would give unexpected result if `x` is a vector of length 0 or `NULL`. In that case, `for` loop would execute without any warning or error.
