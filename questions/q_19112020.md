A test has a true positive rate of 100% and false positive rate of 5%. In this population 1 out of 1000 people have the condition the test identifies. Given a positive test, what is the probability this person actually has the condition?

## Options:
1. 0.5
2. 0.001
3. 0.0196
4. 1

## Correct Option:
3. 0.0196

## Explanation:
Using Baye's theorem:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(A)P(B|A) + P(\bar A)P(B|\bar A)}
$$

Which in this case translates to:

$$
P(disease|positive) = \frac{P(disease)P(positive|disease)}{P(disease)P(positive|disease) + P(noDisease)P(positive|noDisease)}
$$

It is given that:

$$
P(disease) = \frac{1}{1000}\\
P(positive|disease) = 1\\
P(positive|noDisease) = 0.05\\
P(noDisease) = 1 - \frac{1}{1000}\\
$$

Plug in the values and you get 0.0196
