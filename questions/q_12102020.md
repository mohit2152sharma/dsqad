## Question:
The length of `a` and `b` in R is:
```r
a = c(1, 2, 3, NULL)
b = list(1, 2, 3, NULL)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Length

## Options:
1. 3 and 3
2. 3 and 4
3. 4 and 4
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
2. 3 and 4

## Explanation:
The length of `a` is 3 and length of `b` is 4. In a vector, the `NULL` objects are silently dropped whereas a list can contain `NULL` objects.
```r
a = c(1, 2, 3, NULL)
b = list(1, 2, 3, NULL)
length(a)
#> [1] 3
length(b)
#> [1] 4
```
