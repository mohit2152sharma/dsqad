## Question:
It has been shown many times that on a certain memory test, recognition is substantially better than recall. However, the p-value for the data from your sample was 0.12, so you were unable to reject the null hypothesis that recall and recognition produce the same results. What type of error did you make?

## Options:
1. Type I Error
2. Type II Error

## Correct Option:
2. Type II Error

## Explanation:
In this example, there is really a difference in the population between recognition and recall, but you did not find a significant difference in your sample. Failing to reject a false null hypothesis is a Type II error.
