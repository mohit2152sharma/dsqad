## Question:
Assuming, only the following information is provided to you about the residuals' distributions of different linear regression models, and then asked to choose the best model among the following options? Note the following notations: median: median, min: minimum, max: maximum

## Topic:
Linear Regression

## Options:
1. min = -0.404; median = -0.002; max = 0.405
2. min = -0.567; median = 6.859; max = 10.983
3. min = -4.734; median = 0.05; max = 40.845
4. min = -0.435; median = 0.019; max = -0.125

## Correct Option:
1. min = -0.404; media = -0.002; max = 0.405

## Explanation:
In linear regression, the error terms are assumed to follow normal distribution. Therefore, the min and max should be somewhat similar and median should be close to mean i.e. zero. The option 2 and 3, with their minimum and maximum not similar, probably point to a skewed distribution. Option 4 is absurd, median lies between minimum and maximum. So option 1 is correct, which seemed to follow the assumptions of linear regression better than other options.
