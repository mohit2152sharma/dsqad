## Options:
1. 1 and 2 are correct
2. 2 and 4 are correct
3. 2 and 3 are correct
4. 1 and 3 are correct

## Correct Option:
1. 1 and 2 are correct

## Explanation:
In python, `=` is called an assignment operator, which is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operator can be used with mathematical operators (like add, subtract, multiply) on numerical values, together they are called compound operators, as they combine together a numeric operation (such as add) with the assignment operator.
```python
x += 1  #is same as: x = x+1
x *= 1  #is same as: x = x*1
x -= 1  #is same as: x = x-1
x /= 1  #is same as: x = x/1
x //= 1 #is same as: x = x//1
x %= 1  #is same as: x = x%1
x **= 1 #is same as: x = x**1
```
