## Question:
By default when you create a factor in R, the `NA`'s are not included as a level. Which of the following would include `NA` as a level?
``` r
x = factor(c(1, 1, 2, NA))
x
#> [1] 1    1    2    <NA>
#> Levels: 1 2
```

## Options:
1. `x = factor(c(1,1,2,NA))`
2. `x = factor(c(1,1,2,NA), levels = c(1,2,NA))`
3. `x = factor(c(1,1,2,"NA"))`
4. `x = factor(c(1,1,2,NA), exclude=NULL)`

## Correct Option:
4. `x = factor(c(1,1,2,NA), exclude=NULL)`

## Explanation:
`factor()` takes an additional argument `exclude`, which can be used to exclude levels. `exclude` can be a vector, which excludes the characters (or numbers) from a given factor `f`. Excluding non-existing character levels is equivalent to excluding nothing. By default `exclude=NA`, hence `NA` is not shown as a level. By setting `exclude=NULL`, you are explicitly mentioning to exclude nothing including `NA`'s.
``` r
x = factor(c(1,1,2,NA), exclude=NULL)
x
#> [1] 1    1    2    <NA>
#> Levels: 1 2 <NA>
```
