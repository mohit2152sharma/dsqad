## Topic:
1. Probability
2. Normal Distributions
	
## Options:
1. $\mu_1 > \mu_2 > \mu_3$
2. $\mu_1 < \mu_2 < \mu_3$
3. $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
2. $\mu_1 < \mu_2 < \mu_3$

## Explanation:
$\mu_1 < \mu_2 < \mu_3$ is correct. As for the CDFs of normal distributions, the curve is bounded between 0 and 1, as the $\sigma$ (std. deviation) increases the curve becomes more and more flat (towards x axis) and as $\mu$ increases the curve shifts more and more towards right.
