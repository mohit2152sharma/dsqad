## Question:
The following in R would return?
```r
as.logical(c(TRUE, "true", T, 1))
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Booleans

## Options:
1. TRUE NA TRUE TRUE
2. NA NA NA NA
3. TRUE TRUE TRUE NA
4. TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

## Correct Option:
3. TRUE TRUE TRUE NA

## Explanation:
Character strings `c("T", "TRUE", "True", "true")` are regarded as true, `c("F", "FALSE", "False", "false")` as false, and all others as NA. The first three values of `c(TRUE, "true", T, 1)` are regarded as `TRUE` and due to implicit coercion, the numeric `1` is coerced to character `"1"` and `as.logical()` gives `NA` for it.
``` r
x = c(TRUE, "true", "T", 1)
x[4]
#> [1] "1"
as.logical(x)
#> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE   NA
```
