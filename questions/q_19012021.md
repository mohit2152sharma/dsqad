## Question:
It's given that `x` and `y` are factors. Which of the following statement is correct for the following command?

```
x:y
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R

## Options:
1. output would be of numeric class
2. output will be a numeric sequence from the minimum to maximum level of `x` and `y`
3. output will be of factor class and similar to `interaction(a,b)`
4. Both 1 and 2
 
## Correct Option:
3. output will be of factor class and equivalent to `interaction(a,b)`

## Explanation:
The binary operator `:` in R has two meanings. For factors `a:b` is equivalent to `interaction(a,b)` except the levels' labelling and ordering is different. For numeric arguments `from:to`, the result is equivalent to `seq(from:to)` which generates a sequence from `from` to `to` in steps of 1 or -1.

``` r
x = factor(c(1,2))
y = factor(c(3,4))

x:y
#> [1] 1:3 2:4
#> Levels: 1:3 1:4 2:3 2:4

interaction(x,y)
#> [1] 1.3 2.4
#> Levels: 1.3 2.3 1.4 2.4
```
