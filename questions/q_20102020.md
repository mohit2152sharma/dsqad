## Question:
Following we are showing two commands 1 and 2. Both are used to apply an `if` `else` condition to find the poistive and negative numbers (abbreviated as p and n). What would two commnand give as an output?
```r
x = c(-1, -2, 1)

#command 1
if(x > 0) "p" else "n"

#command 2
ifelse(x > 0, "p", "n")
```

2. R
3. `ifelse`

## Options:
1. 1 would give "p" and 2 would give "n" "n" "p"
2. 1 would give "n" and 2 would give "n" "n" "p"
3. Both will give the same result
4. 1 would give "n" "n" "p" and 2 would give "n"

## Correct Option:
2. 1 would give "n" and 2 would give "n" "n" "p"

## Explanation:
`if()...else...` is non vectorized and if in case you provide a vector to it, it only checks the first element of the vector for the condition and produces the output based on that test. Whereas, `ifelse()` is vectorized and takes three argument: `ifelse(condition, values to return if test is true, values to return if test is false)`.

```r
x = c(-1, -2, 1)
if(x > 0) "p" else "n"
#> Warning in if (x > 0) "p" else "n": the condition has length > 1 and only the
#> first element will be used
#> [1] "n"
ifelse(x > 0, "p", "n")
#> [1] "n" "n" "p"
```
