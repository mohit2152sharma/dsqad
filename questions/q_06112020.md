## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Control Statement

## Options:
1. 1 and 3
2. 1 and 4
3. 2 and 3
4. 2 and 4

## Correct Option:
1. 1 and 3

## Explanation:
Option 1 and option 2 shows how the `if` `else` statement are to be written with the only difference of keyword `then` among them. Python doesn't use the keyword `then` for control statements. Hence Option 1 is correct. Option 3 and option 4 shows one of the nice feature of python i.e. comprehension. An `if` `else` can be comprehensively written in a single line. The correct syntax for that is: `<result1> if <condition-is-met> else <result2>`, which is the option 3.
