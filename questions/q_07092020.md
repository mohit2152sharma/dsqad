## Question:
From the given list, you are trying to access "hello", which of the following command would work?
```r
z = list( a = list( b = 9, c = "hello"), d = 1:5)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Indexing

## Options:
1. `z$a$c`
2. `z[['a']]$c`
3. `z[[c('a', 'c')]]`
4. All of the above

## Correct Option:
4. All of the above

## Explanation:
In R, `$`, `[` and `[[` are used for indexing. The most important difference between `[`, `[[` and `$` is that the `[` can select more than one elements while the other two select a single element. The main difference between `$` and `[[` is that `$` does not allow computed indices whereas `[[` does. `z[['a']]` is equivalent to `z$a`. `[[` can be applied recursively to lists as shown in option 3, `z[[c('a', 'c')]]` is equivalent to `z[['a']][['c']]`.
