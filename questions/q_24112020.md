## Question:
Suppose in R, a function named `greeting()` has been defined which takes two arguments `first_name` and `last_name` i.e. `greeting(first_name, last_name)`. Which of the following would not thrown an error?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Functions

## Options:
1. `greeting(first_name = "Monty", last_name = "Python")`
2. `greeting(first = "Monty", last = "Python)`
3. `greeting("Monty", "Python")`
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
4. None of the above

## Explanation:
All the options stated above would execute and give the same result. In R, function arguments are partially matched to their names, as in the option 2. The order for operation when given an argument is:

1. Check for exact match for a named argument
2. Check for partial match
3. Check for positional match
``` r
greeting = function(first_name, last_name){
  print(paste(first_name, last_name, sep= ", "))
}

greeting("Monty", "Python")
#> [1] "Monty, Python"
greeting(first_name = "Monty", last_name = "Python")
#> [1] "Monty, Python"
greeting(first = "Monty", last = "Python")
#> [1] "Monty, Python"
```
