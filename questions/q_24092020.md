```

## Topic:

## Options:
1. We will get an error
2. Matrix x will be replaced with new variable x whose value is 0
3. All elements of x gets replaced by 0, keeping the same number of rows and columns
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
3. All elements of x gets replaced by 0, keeping the same number of rows and columns

## Explanation:
If x is a matrix, `x[] <- 0` will replace every element with 0, keeping the same number of rows and columns. In contrast, `x <- 0` completely replaces the matrix with the value 0.
