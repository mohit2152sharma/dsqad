$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1\\4 & 2\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Topic:

2. Linear Algebra

## Options:
1. $\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4\\1 & -2\end{bmatrix}$

2. $\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -4\\-1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$

3. $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2\\-2 & 4\end{bmatrix}$

4. Matrix is not invertible

## Correct Option:
The matrix is not invertible as the determinant of it is zero. For $2\times2$ matrices, the determinant is the difference between the products of its diagonals.
