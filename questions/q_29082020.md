## Question:
Out of 10k obs in my sample, I have 1k obs belonging to category 1 and 9k obs to category 0. I build a binary classifier model that always predicts category 0 and got 90% accuracy on my training set. Is this a good model?

## Topic:

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
No the model is not good. There are two types of error being made here. One, the model incorrectly assigns the variable of category 1 to category 0 and the second being, model incorrectly assigns the variable of category 0 to category 1. It’s often of interest to see which error is being made. Take for example if you are building a spam mail detection system. Your sample includes lots of examples of spam mails whereas very few examples of not-spam mail, let’s say 9k spam mail examples and 1k not-spam mail example. If you happen to build a basic classifier model which always predict spam, even though the model is accurate 90% of time, it is not useful because this model would classify all the useful not-spam mail to spam mail. A confusion matrix is a simple and useful way to display this information.
