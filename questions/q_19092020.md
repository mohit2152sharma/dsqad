## Question:
Super assignment operator `<<-`can be used for assignment in parent environment. Which of the following is TRUE for the following code?

```r
x <- 0

f <- function(){
  x <<- x + 1
  x
}

#1st execution
A = f()
#2nd execution
B = f()
#3rd execution
C = f()
```

2. R
3. Super Assignment Operator

## Options:
1. A = B = C
2. C > B > A
3. C < B < A
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
2. C > B > A

## Explanation:
`<<-` is known as super assignment operator. In contrast to the regular assignment operator `<-` which does the assignment in current environment, `<<-` does the assignment in parent environment. If in case it doesn’t find the variable, it will create the variable in global environment. See for example below:

I have defined a function `f` with a variable `y` in it to which I have assigned 1. If I try to access `y` outside function, I get the error, as `y` doesn’t exist in global environment. It only exists in `f`’s environment.
``` r
f <- function(){
  y <- 1
}
#function call
f()
y
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'y' not found
```
But if I rewrite the above code using `<<-`, I don't get any error. `y` is now defined in global environment.
``` r
f <- function(){
  y <<- 1
}
#function call
f()
y
#> [1] 1
```
So for the above question, `C=3`, `B=2`, `A=1`. At the first execution, `f` returns `1` and also updates `x` in global environment to `1`. Similary for the subsequent executions, `x` gets updated globablly with an increment 1.
``` r
x <- 0

f <- function(){
  x <<- x + 1
  x
}

#1st execution
A = f()
#2nd execution
B = f()
#3rd execution
C = f()

A
#> [1] 1
B
#> [1] 2
C
#> [1] 3
```
In contrast, if I use `<-`, I would get `A=B=C=1`.
``` r
x <- 0

f <- function(){
  x <- x + 1
  x
}

#1st execution
A = f()
#2nd execution
B = f()
#3rd execution
C = f()

A
#> [1] 1
B
#> [1] 1
C
#> [1] 1
```
