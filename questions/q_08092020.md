## Question:
Below are shown two ways of selecting an element from a matrix, should you expect the same output from the two commands in R?

```r
m = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
m

#First method
m[i=1, j=2]

#Second method
m[j=2, i=1]
```

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
When indexing with `[`, they do not match their index arguments in the standard way: argument names are ignored and positional matching only is used. So `m[j = 2, i = 1]` is equivalent to `m[2, 1]` and not to `m[1, 2]`.

This may not be true for methods defined for them; for example it is not true for the `data.frame` methods described in `[.data.frame` which warn if `i` or `j` is named and have undocumented behaviour in that case.

To avoid confusion, do not name index arguments (but `drop` and `exact` must be named).
