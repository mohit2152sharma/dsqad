## Question:
What would be the output of following code?

```r
x = 1:12
NROW(x)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `NROW`

## Options:
1. Error
2. `NULL`
3. 12
4. 1

## Correct Option:
3. 12

## Explanation:
Apart from the more well known functions `nrow()` and `ncol()`, there are two more functions: `NROW()` and `NCOL()`. `nrow(x)` and `ncol(x)` return the number of rows and columns present in `x`. `NCOL` and `NROW` do the same but also treats vector as 1 column matrix, even a 0-length vector. This is for compatibility with `as.matrix()` and `cbind()`.

``` r
NROW(1:12)
#> [1] 12
NROW(NULL)
#> [1] 0
NCOL(1:12)
#> [1] 1
NCOL(NULL)
#> [1] 1
```
