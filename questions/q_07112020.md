4. 1, 2, 3, and 4

## Correct Option1.
4. 1, 2, 3, and 4

## Explanation:
Python is actually quite flexible when it comes to what actually is used to represent True and False, in fact the following rules apply:
1. 0, '' (empty strings), None equate to False 
2. Non zero, non empty strings, any object equate to True.
 
However, it is recommended to stick just to True and False as it is often a cleaner and safer approach.
