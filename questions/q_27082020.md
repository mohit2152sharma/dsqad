## Question:
Output of following is:
```r
x = -1
1:x
```

## Topic:
1. R programming
2. `:` operator

## Options:
1. 1 0 -1
2. Error
3. NA
4. 1 0

## Correct Option:
1. 1 0 -1

## Explanation:
The binary operator `:` has two meanings, for factors, `a:b` is equivalent to `interaction(a, b)`. For other arguments `a:b` is equivalent to `from:to` which is equivalent to `seq(from, to)` and generates a sequence from `from` to `to` in steps of `1` or `-1`.
