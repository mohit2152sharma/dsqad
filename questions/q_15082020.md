## Question:
What would the following code return in R?
```r
isTRUE(c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))
isFALSE(c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))
```

## Topic:
1. R programming

## Options:
1. FALSE TRUE
2. FALSE FALSE
3. NA NA
4. NULL NULL

## Correct Option:
2. FALSE FALSE

## Explanation:
Under the hood, both `isTRUE()` and `isFALSE()` are checking four conditions among which one is for the length of input, if the length of input is not equal to 1, the function returns FALSE. These functions are safer to use in `if` expressions, provided you are not passing a vector to them.
