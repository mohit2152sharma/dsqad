## Question:
A coin gave 115 heads when tossed 200 times. To test if the coin is fair or not, I conducted a one-tailed binomial test, to test if the coin is giving more heads than expected. I got a p-value of 0.02. Again my friend suggested to test the fairness of coin, I should use two-tailed test, so I doubled the p-value to 0.04, and concluded coin is biased. Have I made a mistake in my conclusion?

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
2. No

## Explanation:
In order to consider both the biases i.e. coin is biased towards generating more and less heads then expected, we use a two-tailed test. Note that to do this we cannot simply double the one-tailed p-value unless the probability of the event is 1/2. This is because the binomial distribution becomes asymmetric as that probability deviates from 1/2. As in this case, the probability of a fair coin in 0.5, so we can double the p-value.
