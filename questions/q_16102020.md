## Question:
If you have n distinct observations, how many distinct bootstrap samples are there?

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Probability and Statistics
3. Bootstrap

## Options:
1. $\binom{n}{n}$
2. $\binom{n}{1}$
3. $\binom{2n-1}{n}$
4. $\binom{2n+1}{n}$

## Correct Option:
3. $\binom{2n-1}{n}$

## Explanation:
The problem is similar to putting $n$ different balls into $n$ different boxes. Imagine each observation to be a ball, now to create boxes, you put down $n-1$ `|`, something like `oo||o|ooo|oo|o`. Now there are $n-1$ bars and $n$ balls i.e. $2n-1$ total positions from which to choose $n-1$ bar's positions. Thus, total bootstrap samples $\binom{2n-1}{n-1}$. Note that $\binom{2n-1}{n-1}$ is equal to $\binom{2n-1}{n}$
