## Question:
You are creating a function, but you are not sure of how many arguments will be supplied to it. Which of the following options is the correct way to deal with such scenarios?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Arbitary Arguments

## Options:
1. ```python
	def greeting(names):
    	for name in names:
        	print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```
2. ```python
	def greeting(*names):
    	for name in names:
        	print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```
3. ```python
	def greeting(**names):
    	for name in names:
        	print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```
4. ```python
	def greeting(...):
    	for name in list(...):
        	print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```

## Correct Option:
2. ```python
	def greeting(*names):
    	for name in names:
        	print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```

## Explanation:
Python allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments into a function and then process those arguments inside the function.

To define a parameter list as being of arbitrary length, a parameter is marked with an asterisk (*). For example:
```python
>>> def greeting(*names):
... 	for name in names:
...			print(f"Hello {name}")
...
>>> greeting("Tony", "Peter", "Vision")
Hello Tony
Hello Peter
Hello Vision
```
