## Question:
As we know, a list in R can contain a `NULL` object, as shown below. What happens when we try to reassign an element of a list to `NULL` object, as shown below?
``` r
x = list(a=1, b=2, c=NULL)
x
#> $a
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $b
#> [1] 2
#> 
#> $c
#> NULL
x[['b']] = NULL
```

## Options:
1. `b` changes to `NULL` from 2
2. `b` gets removed from `x`
3. Nothing happens
4. Error: Incorrect assignment operation

## Correct Option:
2. `b` gets removed from `x`
 
## Explanation:
Although list can hold `NULL` objects, but when one tries to change an existing object to `NULL`, it gets removed. This is a common practice if one wants remove elements from list (or vector or dataframe), assign them to `NULL`.
``` r
x = list(a=1, b=2, c=NULL)
x
#> $a
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $b
#> [1] 2
#> 
#> $c
#> NULL
x[['b']] = NULL
x
#> $a
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $c
#> NULL
```
