## Question:
Precision and recall are often at odds with each other. You are building a heart disease prediction model, which given a patient's records predicts whether the person has heart disease or not. Which one should you maximize over other?

2. Probability and Statistics
3. Type 1 error and Type 2 error

## Options:
1. Precision over Recall
2. Recall over Precision
3. Doesn't matter

## Correct Option:
2. Recall over Precision

## Explanation:
In the medical community, a false negative i.e. a person who in actual has the disease is predicted as not having the disease, is more disastrous than a false positive i.e. a person who in actual doesn't have the disease is predicted as having the disease. Recall should be maximised over precision. However, you could have 100% recall yet have a useless model: if your model always outputs a positive prediction, it would have 100% recall but be completely uninformative.
