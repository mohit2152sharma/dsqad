## Question:
It's given `x` is of type `None`. Which of the following would result in `True` in Pyton?

1. `x == None`
2. `x = None`
3. `x is None`
4. `x in None`

## Options:
1. 1 and 3
2. 2 and 3
3. 1 and 4
4. 2 and 4

## Correct Option:
1. 1 and 3

## Explanation:
`x == None` and `x is None` would return `True`. But the two operators are not equivalent. PEP-8 recommends that comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with `is` or `is not`, never the equality operators. `==` is used to check for equality and `is` is used to check against object's identity.

For example:
```python
>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> lst == lst[:] #since both objects are equivalent
True
>>> lst is lst[:] #since both are not the same
False
```
