## Question:
The difference between `geom_path()` and `geom_line()` is:

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. GGPlot

## Options:
1. Both are same
2. `geom_line()` connects observations in original order whereas `geom_path()` connects observations ordered by x values
3. `geom_line()` connects observations ordered by x values whereas `geom_path()` connects observations in original order
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
3. `geom_line()` connects observations ordered by x values whereas `geom_path()` connects observations in original order

## Explanation:
`geom_line()` connects observations ordered by x values whereas `geom_path()` connects observations in original order.

```r
tble = data.frame(x = c(1,3,2,4),
                  y = c(2,5,1,3))
tble
#>   x y
#> 1 1 2
#> 2 3 5
#> 3 2 1
#> 4 4 3
```
```r
ggplot(tble, aes(x,y)) + geom_line()
```

```
