## Question:
Let's say you have a vector of length 5, and you wanted to change it's elements iteratively. So, you wrote a for loop as shown below. What would happen when you run the following code?
```r
x = numeric(5)
for(i in 1:6){
    x[i] = i
}
```

## Topic:
1. R programming

## Options:
1. `x` length will change to 6
2. Index out of range error 
3. The code will run without error but x will still be of length 5
4. None of the above
 
## Correct Option:
1. `x` length will change to 6

## Explanation:
We will not get an error, rather the length of `x` would change to 6 and the new element will be inserted at position 6.
```r
> x = numeric(5)
> for(i in 1:6){
>     x[i] = i
> }
> x
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
