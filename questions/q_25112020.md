## Question:
It is known that `paste()` can take arbitrary number of arguments in R. Which of the following execution of paste would throw an error?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Functions

## Options:
1. `paste("a", "b", sep = ", ")`
2. `paste("a", "b", se = ", ")`
3. `paste(sep = ", ", "a", "b")`
4. None of the above

## Correct Option:
4. None of the above

## Explanation:
`...` can be used to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function. But there is one catch, i.e. the arguments which appear after `...` need to be named explicitly and cannot be partially matched or matched positionally. For example, in option 2, `sep` argument is not fully specified but relied on partial matching which doesn't give expected result. 
``` r
paste("a", "b", sep = ", ")
#> [1] "a, b"
paste("a", "b", se = ", ")
#> [1] "a b , "
paste(sep = ", ", "a", "b")
#> [1] "a, b"
```
