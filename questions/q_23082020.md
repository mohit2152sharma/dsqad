## Question:
The null and alternate hypothesis of ANOVA are:
1. The groups have same mean i.e. $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_n$
2. At least one of the group mean differs from rest of the group means. 
3. The groups have same variances i.e. $\sigma^{2}_{1} = \sigma^{2}_{2} = ... = \sigma^{2}_{n}$
4. The groups do not have same variances i.e. $\sigma^{2}_{1} \ne \sigma^{2}_{2} \ne ... \ne \sigma^{2}_{n}$

## Topic:
1. ANOVA
2. Hypothesis Testing

## Options:
1. 1 is alternate hypothesis and 2 is null hypothesis
2. 1 is null hypothesis and 2 is alternate hypothesis
3. 3 is alternate hypothesis and 4 is null hypothesis
4. 3 is null hypothesis and 4 is alternate hypothesis

## Correct Option:
2. 1 is null hypothesis and 2 is alternate hypothesis

## Explanation:
Although the name is analysis of variance but in hypothesis testing the means of groups are comapred. The null hypothesis being that, the groups have same mean i.e. $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_n$ and alternate hypothesis being that, at least one of the group mean differs from rest of the group means. The statistical significance is tested by computing F-test statistic.
