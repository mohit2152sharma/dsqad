## Question:
To reduce the probability of committing a type 1 error:

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Statstics
3. Type 1 and Type 2 Error

## Options:
1. increase alpha (significance level)
2. decrease alpha (significance level)
3. increase sample size
4. None

## Correct Option:
2. decrease alpha (significance level)

## Explanation:
In statistical hypothesis testing, type 1 error is the rejection of true null hypothesis (false positives) while type 2 error is non-rejection of false null hypothesis (false negatives). Significance level (alpha) or type 1 error rate is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that is true (usually set to 0.05). By setting different significance level, you can control the quality of experiment. Setting a lower level of significance level (say 0.01) would reduce your chances of getting a type 1 error.
