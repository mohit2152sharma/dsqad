## Question:
In R, would the following work?
```r
z = function(...){
	..1 + ..2 + ..3 + ..4
}
z(1,2,3,4)
```

## Topic:
1. R Programming
2. `...` operator

## Options:
1. Yes, output would be 10
2. No, will get an error
3. No, will get `NULL` as output
 
## Correct Option:
1. Yes, output would be 10

## Explanation:
In R, `...`(dot-dot-dot) are special argument with which a function can take any additional number of arguments. Although rare, but using a special form, `..N`, it's possible to refer elements of `...` by position.
```r
> z = function(...){
+	..1 + ..2 + ..3 + ..4
+}
>
> z(1,2,3,4)
[1] 10
```
