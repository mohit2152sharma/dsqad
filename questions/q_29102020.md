## Question:
What would the following return in R?
*Note the following is an edge case in R, so it's okay if you get it wrong*

```r
(-8)^(1/3)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `double`

## Options:
1. `NA`
2. `2`
3. `-2`
4. `NaN`

## Correct Option:
4. `NaN`

## Explanation:
People are sometimes surprised by the value returned, for example why `(-8)^(1/3)` is `NaN`. For double inputs, R makes use of IEC 60559 arithmetic on all platforms, together with the C system function `pow` for the `^` operator. The relevant standards define the result in many corner cases. In particular, the result in the example above is mandated by the C99 standard. On many Unix-alike systems the command `man pow` gives details of the values in a large number of corner cases.
