## Question:
Which of the following is not a correct anonymous function in python? 

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. Python
3. Global Variables

## Options:
1. `func1 = lambda: print("anonymous function")`
2. `func2 = function(x) x^2`
3. `func3 = lamda x: x^2`
4. `func4 = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z`

## Correct Option:
2. `func2 = function(x) x^2`

## Explanation:
Anonymous functions are defined using the keyword lambda and for this reason they are also known as lambda functions. The syntax used to define an anonymous function is:
```
lambda arguments: expression
```
Anonymous functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression (that is a statement that returns a value) as their body. The expression is executed, and the value generated from it is returned as the result of the function.
