## Question:
What would be the output of the following?

```
1.3:3.4
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Sequence

## Options:
1. `1 2 3`
2. `2 3 4`
3. `1.3 2.3 3.3`
4. `NA`

## Correct Option:
3. `1.3 2.3 3.3`

## Explanation:
The binary operator `:` in R has two meanings. For factors `a:b` is equivalent to `interaction(a,b)` except the levels' labelling and ordering is different. For numeric arguments `from:to`, the result is equivalent to `seq(from:to)` which generates a sequence from `from` to `to` in steps of 1 or -1.

``` r
1.3:3.4
#> [1] 1.3 2.3 3.3
```
