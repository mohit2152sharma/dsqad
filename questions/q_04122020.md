## Question:
$A$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & 0\\0 & a_{22}\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Topic:

2. Linear Algebra

## Options:
1. $0, 0$
2. $1, 1$
3. $a_{11}, a_{22}$
4. Incomplete information provided

## Correct Option:
3. $a_{11}, a_{22}$

## Explanation:
An eigenvector for a square matrix $A$ is a non-zero vector that satisfies the equation

$$
Ax = \lambda x
$$

where $\lambda$ is a scalar and is the associated eigenvalue. Solving the above equation gives: 

$$
Ax - \lambda x = 0 
$$
$$
(A - \lambda I)x = 0
$$

where $I$ is identity matrix. As $x$ is non-zero vector then, $(A - \lambda I)$ is a singular matrix i.e. the determinant of it is zero. Therefore:

$$
A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} - \lambda & a_{12}\\a_{21} & a_{22} - \lambda\end{bmatrix}
$$
has a zero determinant, i.e. 

$$
(a_{11} - \lambda)(a_{22} - \lambda) - a_{21}a_{12} = 0
$$
Since $A$ is a square matrix with $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ equal to zero, $\lambda$'s value are $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$
