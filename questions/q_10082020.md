## Question:
In a linear regression setting of the form Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3, the  R square was found to be 0.81, the pearson correlation coefficient between Y and X1 is?

## Topic:
1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient
2. R square

## Options:
1. 0.9
2. Incorrect question
3. 0.6561
4. 0.27

## Correct Option:
2. Incorrect question

## Explanation:
In a simple linear regression setting i.e. Y ~ X, it can be shown that square of pearson correlation coefficient is equal to R square. But the same doesn't simply extend to multiple linear regression. In multiple linear regression setting R square is equal to the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. Moreover, R square is the measure of variance explained by our model.
