## Question:
What would be the class of the following `test` object in R? (`%>%` is the pipe operator from magrittr package)

```r
test <- . %>% sin %>% cos %>% tan
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Pipe operator (magrittr package)

## Options:
1. Error: . object not found
2. Function
3. NULL
4. list

## Correct Option:
2. Function

## Explanation:
When the dot is used as LHS, the result will be a functional sequence, i.e. a function which applies the entire chain of right-hand sides in turn to its input. 

``` r
library(magrittr)
test <- . %>% sin %>% cos %>% tan
test(1:10)
#>  [1] 0.7863574 0.7053391 1.5238730 0.8895923 0.6471951 1.4320633 1.0129597
#>  [8] 0.6120411 1.3031619 1.1513517
```
