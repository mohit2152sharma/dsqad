## Question:
What happens when you try to index with `NA`?
```r
x = 1:6
y = c(T, F, F, NA)
x[y]
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Indexing

## Options:
1. `1 NA 5`
2. Error, invalid indexing key
3. `NA NA NA NA NA NA`
4. `1 2 3 NA 5 6`

## Correct Option:
1. `1 NA 5`

## Explanation:
There are two things to note here. First: Indexing with NA, and Second: Indexing with logicals. When you index with NA, you get NA. When you index with logical vectors, the positions with `TRUE` gets selected and the ones with `FALSE` are dropped. If in case your logical vector is of smaller length, the elements are recycled to match the corresponding length. So in the above example: `y` is of length 4, so when used as `x[y]`, `y` gets recycled to `(T, F, F, NA, T, F)` and `x` is indexed as `x[c(T, F, F, NA, T, F)]`. Since position `1` and `5` are `TRUE`, those will be returned, the ones with `FALSE` will not be returned and the position which has `NA` will return `NA`. So the output will be `1 NA 5`.
