## Question:
It is given that there is no package named `xyz`. What will the last line of code return in R?

```r
x = require(xyz)
typeof(x)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `require()`

## Options:
1. Error, as first line would fail
2. Logical
3. Character
4. `NULL`

## Correct Option:
2. Logical

## Explanation:
`require(package)` load the namespace of the package with name `package` and attach it on the search list. `require` is designed for use inside other functions; it returns `FALSE` and gives a warning (rather than an error as `library()` does by default) if the package does not exist.

``` r
x = require(xyz)
#> Loading required package: xyz
#> Warning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE,
#> logical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called 'xyz'
typeof(x)
#> [1] "logical"
```
