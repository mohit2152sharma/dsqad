## Question:
To assess the purchase likelihood of a product on a shelf, you designed an experiment with two factors, shelf display (organized or disorganized) and product quantity (low, medium, high). Which method should you choose for comparison?

## Topic:
1. ANOVA
2. One way ANOVA
3. Two way ANOVA

## Options:
1. One way ANOVA
2. Two way ANOVA
3. paired t-test
4. unpaired t-test

## Correct Option:
2. Two way ANOVA

## Explanation:
In the two-way ANOVA model, there are two factors, each with several levels, like in the above example: shelf display (organized and disorganized) and product quantity (low, medium, high). 
A two-way design is advantageous over two single-factor studies as it is more efficient to study factors simultaneously than separately, also we can investigate interactions between factors.
