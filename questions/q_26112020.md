## Question:
Suppose you are given two matrices, $A$ with dimension $m \times n$ and $B$ with dimension $n \times l$. What would be the dimension of matrice resulting from the multiplication $A$ and $B$ i.e $A \times B$?

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Linear Algebra

## Options:
1. $m \times n$
2. $n \times l$
3. $m \times l$
4. $n \times n$

## Correct Option:
3. $m \times l$

## Explanation:
For general matrices, the product $C = AB$ is defined as

$$
C_{ij} = \sum_i^k A_{ik}B_{kj}
$$

$A$ and $B$ must have same inner dimensions, implying that if $A$ has dimension $m \times n$ and $B$ has dimesnion $n \times l$, then the resultant matrix $C$ would have the dimension $m \times l$.
