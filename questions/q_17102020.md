3. 2 and 4 are correct
4. 1, 2 and 3 are correct

## Correct Option:
2. 2, 3 and 4 are correct

## Explanation:
To create a string in python, the word has to be enclosed in either of the delimeters `"` or `'`. A single quote can be embedded within double quotes, likewise a double quote can be embedded in single quotes. Python also has a third alternative i.e. the use of triple quotes, which are useful for multiline strings. The special characters can be escaped using `\`.
```python
'Jhon's Wig' #this is wrong
"Jhon's Wig' #this is wrong
"Jhon's Wig" #this is correct
'Jhon\'s Wig' #this is also correct
"""Jhon's Wig""" #this is also correct
```
