## Question:
Which of the following would print the numbers from 1 to 10 in python?
1. ```python
    for i in range(1,10):
        print(i)
    ```
2. ```python
    i = 1
    for _ in range(1,11):
        print(i)
        i = i + 1
    ```
3. ```python
    i = 1
    while i < 11:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    ```
4. ```python

## Options:
1. 1 and 3
2. 1, 2 and 3
3. 3 and 4
4. 2, 3 and 4

## Correct Option:
4. 2, 3 and 4

## Explanation:
`range()` is an in-build function in python. It can take three arguments, `range(start, stop, step)` and produces a sequence of integers from `start` which is included in the sequence to `stop` (which is not included in the sequence) by incrementing (or decrementing) according to `step`. `start` defaults to 0 and `step` defaults to 1. So `range(i, j)` would produce a sequence: `i, i+1, i+2,...,j-1`. 

The `for` loops in python can also use a wild card variable like `_` in option 2. This can be useful if you are only interested in looping a certain number of times and not in the value of loop counter itself.
