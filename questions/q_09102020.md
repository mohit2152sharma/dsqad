## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Assignment

## Options:
1. `<-`
2. `=`
3. `<<-`
4. `->`
5. `->>`
6. All of the above

## Correct Option:
6. All of the above

## Explanation:
In R, There are three different assignment operators: two of them have leftwards and rightwards forms. The operators `<-` and `=` assign into the environment in which they are evaluated.
The operators `<<-` and `->>` are normally only used in functions, and cause a search to be made through parent environments for an existing definition of the variable being assigned. If such a variable is found (and its binding is not locked) then its value is redefined, otherwise assignment takes place in the global environment.
