## Question:
Did you know, `c()` has an additional argument called `recursive`. What happens when following is tried in R?
```r
z = list('a', 'b')
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, z, recursive = TRUE)
class(x)
```

## Topic:

3. `c()`

## Options:
1. character
2. vector
3. list
4. numeric

## Correct Option:
1. character

## Explanation:
The output type is determined from the highest type of the components in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < double < complex < character < list < expression.
Since in this example, `recursive = TRUE`, it recursively descends through lists combining all the elements into a vector and as character comes after integer in hierarchy, the rest of the elements of `x` gets coerced to character.
``` r
z = list('a', 'b')
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, z, recursive = TRUE)
class(x)
#> [1] "character"
```
