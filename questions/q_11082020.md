## Question:
Let's assume the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is 1. Let's also assume $X_a = 1 + X$ and $Y_a = 2 - 3Y$. The correlation between $X_a$ and $Y_a$ is:

## Topic:
1. Pearson correlation coefficient

## Options:
1. 1
2. -1
3. 0
4. None

## Correct Option:
2. -1

## Explanation:
Given two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the correlation is scale and location invariant in the sense that $cor(X,Y) = cor(X_T, Y_T)$, if $X_T = a + bX$ and $Y_T = c + dY$, and $b$ and $d$ have the same sign. Note that if $b > 0$ and $d < 0$ (and vice versa), $cor(X,Y) \neq cor(X_T, Y_T)$ because the sign of the correlation between the transformed random variables will be inverted.
