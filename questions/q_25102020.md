## Options:
1. 1 and 3
2. 1 and 2
3. 1, 2, and 4
4. 1, 3, and 4

## Correct Option:
2. 1 and 2

## Explanation:
In python, you can use multiplication operator in conjuction with strings. When you multiply a string with an integer, say $n$, it creates a new string. This new string is the original string, repeated $n$ number of times.
```python
>>> print("#####") #option 1
#####
>>> print("#"*5) #option 2
#####
>>> print("#*5") #option 3
#*5
>>> print("#", n=5) #option 4

  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'n' is an invalid keyword argument for print()
