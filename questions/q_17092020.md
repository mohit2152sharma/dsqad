## Question:
A dice is thrown 20 times and 13 times I get six. To test whether the dice is fair, I conducted a one-tailed test to test whether dice is biased towards generating more 6s and got p-value of $x$. But my friend suggested that I should do two-tailed binomial test, as to test for the fairness of dice, I should also test if the dice is biased towards generating fewer 6s then expected. Based on my friend's suggestion, I doubled the p-value to $2x$ and drew conclusion that dice is fair. Have I maken a mistake?

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
1. Yes

## Explanation:
When we are testing for fairness of a die, we are also interested if the die is biased towards generating fewer 6s than expected, and not only more 6s. In order to consider both the biases, we use a two-tailed test. Note that to do this we cannot simply double the one-tailed p-value unless the probability of the event is 1/2. This is because the binomial distribution becomes asymmetric as that probability deviates from 1/2. As in this case, the probability of event is 1/6, so we can't double the p-value.
