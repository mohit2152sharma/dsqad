## Topic:

3. Scope

## Options:
1. global
2. local
3. nonlocal
4. above

## Correct Option:
3. nonlocal

## Explanation:
The keyword *nonlocal* indicates to python that the variable is neither global nor local to the current function and python should look within the scope in which the function is defined to find a local variable with the same name.

```python
>>> def add_one():
...     number=10
...     def add():
...             nonlocal number
...             number=number+1
...             return number
...     print(add())
>>> add_one()
11
```
