## Question:
Suppose you want to examine the safety of compact cars, midsize cars, and full-size cars. For a sample of $n$ cars of each type, you collected the reading of pressure applied to the driver's head during the car crash. You conducted the anova test (with $\alpha = 0.05$) to test whether the mean pressure is equal for each types and found the p-value to be 0.0034. Select the true statement.
 
## Topic:
1. ANOVA
	
## Options:
1. The mean pressure is equal for each types 
2. Mean pressure of compact size car is different from that of midsize cars
3. Mean pressure of midsize cars is different from that of full-size cars
4. Mean pressure is not statistically equal for compact, midsize and full-size cars.

## Correct Option:
4. Mean pressure is not statistically equal for compact, midsize and full-size cars.

## Explanation:
Since the p-value of our test is less than our cutoff value, we reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis of anova assumes that population means are equal. However, since only one mean must be different to reject the null, we do not yet know which mean(s) is/are different. In short, an ANOVA test will test us that at least one mean is different, but an additional test must be conducted to determine which mean(s) is/are different.
