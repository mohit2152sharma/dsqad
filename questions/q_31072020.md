## Question:
Given two samples from two different populations, sample A with (mean, std. deviation, n) as (74, 9, 15) and sample B with (mean, std. deviation, n) as (69, 5, 18).Which of the following test should you choose to test the hypothesis that population mean of A is equal to population mean of B?

## Topic:
Welch's t-test

## Options:
1. paired t-test
2. Student's t-test
3. Welch's t-test

## Correct Option:
3. Welch's t-test

## Explanation:
While Welch's t-test is very similar to Student's t-test, except it doesn't assume the two samples to have the same variance. Given our data with different standard deviation, it's safer to use Welch's t-test, avoiding the assumption of same variance. With Student's t-test it is better to first test the assumption of equal variance.
