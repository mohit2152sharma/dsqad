## Question:
In R, let's say you have a vector `x`
```r
x = runif(1e6)
```
The size of `x`, let's assume is 8 MB. Now you create a list `y` as follows
```r
y = list(x, x, x, x, x)
```
What would be the size of `y`?

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. List

## Options:
1. 5 times the size of `x`
2. Roughly same size as `x`
3. 1/5 the size of `x`
4. None of the above
 
## Correct Option:
2. Roughly the same size as `x`

## Explanation:
In R, the lists don't hold the actual object but the references (or like a pointer) to those objects. So the size of list will be much smaller than you expect.
```r
library(lobstr)

x = runif(1e6)
obj_size(x)
#> 8,000,048 B

y = list(x, x, x, x, x)
obj_size(y)
#> 8,000,144 B
```
