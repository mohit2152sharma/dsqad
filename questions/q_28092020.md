## Question:
Itâ€™s possible (although typically not useful) to call an anonymous function. Which of the two approaches below is correct? Why?

```r
# Option A
function(x) 3()

# Option B
(function(x) 3)()
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. functions

## Options:
1. Option A
2. Option B
3. None

## Correct Option:
2. Option B

## Explanation:
When option A is called, it returns an invalid function `3()`, which throws an error. In option B, the anonymous function `function(x) 3` is surrounded by a pair of parentheses before it is called by `()`. These extra parentheses separate the function call from the anonymous functions body. This becomes easier to see if the functions are named.
``` r
fa = function(x) 3()
fa()
#> Error in fa(): attempt to apply non-function

fb = function(x) 3
fb()
#> [1] 3
```
