## Topic:
1. Spearman coefficient

## Options:
1. 0.86
2. 1
3. -1
4. -0.86

## Correct Option:
2. 1

## Explanation:
A Spearman correlation of 1 results when the two variables being compared are monotonically related, even if their relationship is not linear. This means that all data points with greater x values than that of a given data point will have greater y values as well. In contrast, this does not give a perfect Pearson correlation.
