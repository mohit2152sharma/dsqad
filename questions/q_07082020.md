## Question:
While viewing the summary of linear regression model built in R, you sometime see stars for independent variables. For the following example, shown below, which interpretation is correct?

``` r
summary(lm(mpg~cyl+disp+wt, mtcars))
#>
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + wt, data = mtcars)
#> 
#> Residuals:
#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
#> -4.4035 -1.4028 -0.4955  1.3387  6.0722 
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
#> (Intercept) 41.107678   2.842426  14.462 1.62e-14 ***
#> cyl         -1.784944   0.607110  -2.940  0.00651 ** 
#> disp         0.007473   0.011845   0.631  0.53322    
#> wt          -3.635677   1.040138  -3.495  0.00160 ** 
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> 
#> Residual standard error: 2.595 on 28 degrees of freedom
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.8326, Adjusted R-squared:  0.8147 
#> F-statistic: 46.42 on 3 and 28 DF,  p-value: 5.399e-11

## Topic:
Linear Regression in R

## Options:
1. `Intercept` has the strongest relationship with mpg
2. Both `cyl` and `wt` have two stars, so both have equal linear relationship
3. $p-value for `cyl` > p-value for `wt`$, so $slope of `cyl` > slope of `wt`$
4. None of the above
 
## Correct Option:
4. None of the above

## Explanation:
The stars corresponds to different significance levels or the thresholds for $p-value$. Two star means $0.001 < p-value < 0.01$. Depending on your cut-off, you might choose to accept or reject the null hypothesis i.e. $\beta = 0$ for `cyl` (or `wt`) and accept the alternate hypothesis i.e. $\beta \neq 0$. Now if you are accepting the alternate hypothesis, can we say that `mpg` is linearly related with `cyl`? Not really, as without being linearly related, variables can still be significant.
