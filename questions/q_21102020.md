## Question:
`r`, `a` and `b` are numeric vectors.

```r
lmab = lm(r ~ a + b)
lmba = lm(r ~ b + a)
```

Will the coefficients estimates differ?
```r
summary(lmab)
summary(lmba)
```

Will the ANOVA results differ?
```r
anova(lmab)
anova(lmba)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. Anova and Linear Regression

## Options:
1. Estimates are same but ANOVA results are different
2. ANOVA results are same but Estimates are different
3. Both are same
4. Everything is different

## Correct Option:
1. Estimates are same but ANOVA results are different

## Explanation:
In a model such as `~A+B+A:B`, R will report the difference in sums of squares between the models `~1`, `~A`, `~A+B` and `~A+B+A:B`. If the model were `~B+A+A:B`, R would report differences between `~1`, `~B`, `~A+B`, and `~A+B+A:B`. In the first case the sum of squares for `A` is comparing `~1` and `~A`, in the second case it is comparing `~B` and `~B+A`. In a non-orthogonal design (i.e., most unbalanced designs) these comparisons are (conceptually and numerically) different.

There is no need to be agitated about the particular sums of squares that R reports. You can compute your favorite sums of squares quite easily. Any two models can be compared with `anova(model1, model2)`, and `drop1(model1)` will show the sums of squares resulting from dropping single terms.
