## Question:
What would the following return in R?
```r
z = list( 'a', 'b')
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, z)
class(x[1])
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `c()`

## Options:
1. numeric
2. character
3. list
4. vector

## Correct Option:
3. list

## Explanation:
The output type is determined from the highest type of the components in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < double < complex < character < list < expression.
Since `z` is of type `list`, all other elements of `x` will be coerced to `list`

``` r
z = list('a', 'b')
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, z)
class(x[1])
#> [1] "list"
```
