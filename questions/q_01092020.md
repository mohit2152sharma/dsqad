## Question:
To reduce the probability of getting type II error:

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Probability and Statistics
3. Type I error and Type II error

## Options:
1. increase significance level
2. increase sample size
3. Both
4. None

## Correct Option:
2. increase sample size

## Explanation:
In statistical hypothesis testing, type 1 error is the rejection of true null hypothesis (false positives) while type 2 error is non-rejection of false null hypothesis (false negatives). To decrease the probability of committing a Type II error, which is closely associated with analyses' power, either increasing the test's sample size or relaxing the alpha level could increase the analyses' power.
