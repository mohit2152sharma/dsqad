## Question:
James Bond is captured by his enemies. To escape, Mr. Bond has to prove, that he is really good at telling if a martini is stirred or shaken, so he was given a test. Out of 16 trials, he was correct 13 times. Do you have enough evidence that Mr. Bond is just guessing and keep him captive? (Assume significance level = 0.05)

## Options:
1. Yes
2. No

## Correct Option:
1. Yes

## Explanation:
Using binomial test in R and assuming our null hypothesis to be, that Mr. Bond is just guessing, i.e. probability ($p$) of selecting shaken (or stirred) martini is equal to 0.5 and our alternate hypothesis be that he is good at judging $p > 0.5$.

``` r
binom.test(x=13, n=16, p=0.5, alternative='greater')
#> 
#>  Exact binomial test
#> 
#> data:  13 and 16
#> number of successes = 13, number of trials = 16, p-value = 0.01064
#> alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  0.5834277 1.0000000
#> sample estimates:
#> probability of success 
#>                 0.8125
```
As the p-value is less than significance level $(0.01064 < 0.05)$, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis i.e. $p=0.5$ and accept the alternate hypothesis that Mr. Bond is not guessing.
