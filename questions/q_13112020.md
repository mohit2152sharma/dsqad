## Question:
Suppose you build a classifier that answers "yes" on every possible input. What would be the recall of this classifier?

## Topic:
1. Data Science
2. Recall

## Options:
1. 1%
2. 100%
3. 0%
4. 99%

## Correct Option:
2. 100%

## Explanation:
Recall is defined as:
$$ 
Recall = \frac{True Positive}{True Positive + False Negative} $$

For a model that always predicts "yes", there will be no False Negative, so Recall would be 1 (or 100%).
