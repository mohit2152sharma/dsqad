## Question:
For the given list, which of the following option would change `b` to `NULL`?
```r
x = list(a=1, b=2)
```

## Topic:
1. Programming
2. R
3. `NULL`

## Options:
1. `x['b'] = NULL`
2. `x['b'] = list(NULL)`
3. `x[['b']] = NULL`
4. `x[['b']] = list(NULL)`

## Correct Option:
2. `x['b'] = list(NULL)`

## Explanation:
When you assign `NULL` to an element that particular element gets removed, as in the options 1 and 3. To create or assign an element with `NULL` use it with `list()`, which are the options 2 and 4, but with option 4 the element `b` is not changed to `NULL` rather a new element is created inside `b` named as `b` with value `NULL`.
``` r
x <- y <- z <- l <- list(a=1, b=2)
x['b'] = NULL
x
#> $a
#> [1] 1
y['b'] = list(NULL)
y
#> $a
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $b
#> NULL
z[['b']] = NULL
z
#> $a
#> [1] 1
l[['b']] = list(NULL)
l
#> $a
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $b
#> $b[[1]]
#> NULL
```
