# Data Science Question A Day

This is an accompanying repository for the questions posted on Twitter by the account, Data Science Question a Day. You can follow the twitter account [@data_question](https://twitter.com/data_question) for daily questions on Data Science, Machine Learning, R programming and Python (possibly in future).

# How To Contribute?
At present, I am not accepting any questions, primarily because I don't have a manageable system in place to accept user contributions. This will change with future releases.
However, you are free to raise issues for any corrections you find in any of the questions.

# Disclaimer
Although this repository contains questions, the purpose of it is to act as a temporary placeholder for storing questions. Future plan is to migrate questions to more robust database and make the questions accessible via a website.
